(chilli) Pepper
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpangrazzi/pepper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpangrazzi/pepper)

Tiny JS client library for [CoovaChilli JSON Interface](http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/JSON).

Basically it's a rewrite of [ChilliLibrary.js](http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-chilli/www/ChilliLibrary.js) with some improvements:

- code is more modular
- works with [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd) or simply including the minified script and use it globally.
- can be used both in browser or in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- functional tests
- examples

## Examples

### Browserify / Node.js / io.js

`npm install chilli-pepper`, then:

```js
var Pepper = require('chilli-pepper');

var pepper = Pepper({
  host: '192.168.1.1',
  port: 3990
});

pepper.logon('john', 'd0E', function(err, data) {

  if (data.clientState === 1) {
    // User is now logged in
  }

  // ...

});
```

### Global

For globally use Pepper you must build it first. It's very easy:

1. `git clone` this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Build Pepper running `npm run build` or `npm run build-min` (if you want a minified version). You'll find builded version in `./dist` folder
4. Include the builded script in your webapp

Then you'll have a global `Pepper` object ready to use:

```js

var pepper = Pepper({
  host: '192.168.1.1',
  port: 3990
});

pepper.logon('john', 'd0E', function(err, data) {

  if (data.clientState === 1) {
    // User is now logged in
  }

  // ...

});
```

## var pepper = Pepper(options)

Get a new Pepper instance. Available options are listed below.

Note that all options are **optional**: by default Pepper will try to extract required data from CoovaChilli redirect querystring.

- `host`: _String_. Host name (or IP address) of CoovaChilli. If not specified, Pepper will try to extract host from CoovaChilli redirect querystring.

- `port`: _Number_. Port of CoovaChilli. If not specified, Pepper will try to extract host from CoovaChilli redirect querystring.

- `ssl`: _Boolean_. If you're using SSL on CoovaChilli, turn this on. By default, Pepper will automatically set this according to `window.location.protocol`.

- `ident`: _String_. Hex encoded string used for CHAP-Password calculation. Default is `00`.

- `interval`: _Number_. If specified, Pepper will update status informations (clientState, ...) every {interval} ms.

- `uamservice`: _String_. If specified, Pepper will do a JSONP call to this service in order to obtain a CHAP-Password (instead of calculating on the client side). See documentation below for more informations.

- `querystring` _String_: Optional parameter if you want to manually pass CoovaChilli redirect querystring.

Note that Pepper will **throw an exception** if fails to build base CoovaChilli API url. This usually happens if:

- You don't specify host/port
- Pepper can't extract required data from CoovaChilli redirect querystring


## Public methods

#### .refresh(callback)

Update internal status calling CoovaChilli `status` API. Callback is **optional**.

Callback arguments are:

- `err`: Any error encountered during procedure
- `data`: CoovaChilli status response.

#### .logon(username, password[, options], callback)

- `username`: _String_ user's username
- `password`: _String_ user's password
- `options`: _Object_ optional logon options (see below)
- `callback`: _Function_ callback function.

Performs a logon (checking current status first).

Available `options` are:

- `protocol`: _String_ authentication protocol. Currently, `PAP` and `CHAP` are supported, and the default is `CHAP`.

Callback arguments are:

- `err`: Any error encountered during procedure
- `data`: CoovaChilli logon response. If user is correctly authenticated, `clientState` property will be `1` (see examples above).

#### .logoff(callback)

Performs a logoff. Callback is **optional**.

Callback arguments are:

- `err`: Any error encountered during procedure
- `data`: CoovaChilli logoff response.

#### .startAutoRefresh(interval)

- `interval`: _Number_. Interval length in milliseconds.

Starts automatic status refresh every `interval` ms.

Note that this function is called automatically if you specify `interval` option when creating Pepper instance, but you can also call it manually whenever you want.

#### .stopAutoRefresh()

Stops automatic status refresh.


## Public properties

#### .status

User's status object. This will be updated:

- Everytime you call `logon`, `logoff`, or `refresh` methods
- Every `interval` ms (if specified)


## Debug

This library is builded with [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module.

If you want to see debug messages in browser:

```localStorage.debug = '*' // in a JS console```

If you want to see debug messages in Node.js:

```DEBUG=* {yourScript}.js```


## Test

Run tests in Node.js (using [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)):

```npm test```

Run tests in browser:

```npm run test-server```

Then go to `http://localhost:4000`


## TODO

- write more tests
- add test coverage info
